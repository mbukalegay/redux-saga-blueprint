# redux-saga-blueprint
Blueprint for creating a Redux Saga App with TypeScript

After setting up the repo, I ran npx create-react-app redux-saga-blueprint --template typescript to create the project . See the old ReadMe.

- Fixed the files public/html and App.tsx to remove any React text not wished
- Ran yarn Add redux-saga
- Ran yarn Add react-redux
- Ran yarn add @types/react-redux
- Ran yarn add connected-react-router
- Ran yarn Add typesafe-actions
